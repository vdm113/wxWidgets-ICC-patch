wxWidgets 3.0.0-rc2
===================

This directory contains the files for wxWidgets 3.0.0-rc2 release.

Please notice that since the 2.9 series only a single source distribution is
provided instead of the multiple distributions containing only the files for
each port as was done before. So you only need to download wxWidgets-3.0.0.zip
(or .7z for much smaller archive size) for Microsoft Windows systems or
wxWidgets-3.0.0.tar.bz2 for Unix ones, including Mac OS X. The only difference
between these files is that the ZIP (and 7z) archives contain files with DOS
line endings while the tar balls contain files with Unix line endings.
